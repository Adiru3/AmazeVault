# Privacy Policy for AmazeVault

**Last Updated: February 14, 2026**

AmazeVault ("we," "our," or "the Bot") respects your privacy. This policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our Telegram-based cryptocurrency wallet services.

### 1. Information We Collect

We operate on a **minimal data** principle.

*   **Identifiable Information**: We **DO NOT** collect your real name, email address, phone number, IP address, or physical location.
*   **Telegram Data**: We store your public **Telegram User ID** and **Username** solely to link your wallet to your Telegram account. This is the only way for the bot to know "who owns which wallet."
*   **Transaction Data**: We store a history of your Deposits, Withdrawals, and Exchanges (Amounts, TXIDs, Time) to provide you with an accurate account statement. This data is linked only to your Telegram ID.

### 2. Wallet Security & Funds

*   **Non-Custodial Logic**: Your cryptocurrency addresses are generated deterministically using industry-standard algorithms (BIP-39, BIP-44, BIP-84).
*   **Private Keys**: Private keys are generated and encrypted by the bot's core system solely for the purpose of signing transactions you authorize.
*   **No Third-Party Access**: We never share, sell, or expose your private keys or seed phrases to anyone.

### 3. Usage of Third-Party Services

To function, the bot interacts with public blockchain networks and reputable APIs.

*   **Public Blockchains**: When you send a transaction (Withdrawal), the destination address and amount become public record on the respective blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), as is the nature of all crypto transactions.
*   **Price Data**: We use public APIs (like **CoinGecko**) to fetch current exchange rates. These services do not receive your personal data.
*   **Exchange Partners**: For auto-exchange features, we may utilize non-custodial exchange providers (such as **FixedFloat**). In these cases, only the necessary transaction details (Amount, Coin Type, Destination Address) are transmitted to execute the swap.

### 4. Data Retention

We retain transaction history and wallet balances as long as you use the service. You may request account deletion at any time by contacting support, which will remove your data from our active database.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy periodically. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of potential changes.
